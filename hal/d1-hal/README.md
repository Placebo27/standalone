# d1-hal

This package is kept in this folder because the community doesn't have an actual d1-hal
package yet. Once the community provide d1-hal project, we can use that project
instead of keeping a small d1-hal package here.

d1-hal is originally developed for oreboot SoC support package with contributions
from: @YdrMaster, @OrangeCMS and @luojia65.
